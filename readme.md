//This is My Self Guided Android project.
In this project i have made a student registration system, which stores the information of a new student registred through the "studentregistrationapp" and can be fetched and verified through the "AdminAppStudentRegistation".
the student registration app use firestore database at backend to store students data, which consist of college id, branch year etc. this data is than pushed to the firestore data base.
